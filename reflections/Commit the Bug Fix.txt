Leave 'detached HEAD' state
Right now, your HEAD should still be 'detached' from Lesson 1 when you checked out an old commit. To fix that, run the command git checkout master. You'll learn more about what this command does later this lesson.

Fix the delay bug
Now, if you were following along with Caroline, you may have already fixed the bug in the Asteroids repository. If not, go ahead and make the change and add it to the staging area now.

In game.js find the statement if (this.delayBeforeBullet <= 0) { (should be on line 423). On the next line, insert this.delayBeforeBullet = 10;

Stage your change
